Network range appears empty
```

**Symptoms:**
- Scan completes quickly
- No devices discovered
- Even router/gateway not found

**Diagnostic Questions:**
1. Is your computer connected to the network?
2. Can you browse the internet?
3. What's your computer's IP address?

**Step 1: Check network connection**
```cmd
ipconfig /all

# Look for:
IPv4 Address: 192.168.1.100 (your IP)
Default Gateway: 192.168.1.1 (router IP)
Subnet Mask: 255.255.255.0 (network size)
```

**Step 2: Verify network connectivity**
```cmd
# Ping your router
ping 192.168.1.1

# Ping external site
ping google.com
```

**Step 3: Manual network range**
Based on your IP address, try these ranges:
- If your IP is 192.168.1.100 ‚Üí scan 192.168.1.0/24
- If your IP is 10.0.0.25 ‚Üí scan 10.0.0.0/24
- If your IP is 172.16.1.50 ‚Üí scan 172.16.1.0/24

**Step 4: Test specific devices**
```cmd
# Try pinging known devices manually
ping 192.168.1.1    # Router
ping 192.168.1.100  # Your computer
ping 8.8.8.8        # Google DNS
```

**Solutions by Network Type:**

**Home Network (192.168.x.x):**
- Most home routers use 192.168.1.1 or 192.168.0.1
- Check router label for default IP
- Try both /24 ranges if unsure

**Corporate Network:**
- Network may block ICMP (ping)
- Contact IT department
- May need special permissions

**VPN Connection:**
- VPN may change your network range
- Disconnect VPN and try local network
- Or scan VPN subnet if intentional

### Issue 7: Scan finds some devices but not others

**Symptoms:**
- Router found, but not all computers
- Some phones/tablets missing
- Intermittent device detection

**Common Causes:**
1. **Device firewalls** blocking ping
2. **Power saving** modes on laptops/phones
3. **WiFi vs Ethernet** different subnets
4. **Guest networks** isolated from main network

**Solutions:**

**Step 1: Check missing device directly**
```cmd
# From another computer, try pinging missing device
ping 192.168.1.missing-device-ip
```

**Step 2: Device-specific solutions**

**Windows computers not found:**
```cmd
# On the missing Windows PC, run:
# Disable Windows Firewall temporarily to test
# Or allow ICMP in firewall rules
```

**Mac computers not found:**
- Macs often block ping by default
- System Preferences ‚Üí Security ‚Üí Firewall
- Advanced ‚Üí Uncheck "Block all incoming connections"

**Smartphones not found:**
- Many phones ignore ping to save battery
- This is normal behavior
- Use nmap scan for better detection

**IoT devices not found:**
- Smart TVs, cameras may not respond to ping
- Check device network settings
- Some have "stealth mode" enabled

**Step 3: Network configuration issues**

**Multiple WiFi networks:**
- Guest network isolated from main network
- Check which network device is connected to
- Scan appropriate network range

**VLAN segmentation:**
- Corporate networks often use VLANs
- Devices in different VLANs can't see each other
- Contact network administrator

netstat -ano | findstr :5000
```

### Issue 9: Slow performance

**Symptoms:**
- Dashboard takes long time to load
- Scans run very slowly
- Browser becomes unresponsive
- High CPU or memory usage

**Performance Diagnostics:**

**Step 1: Check system resources**
```cmd
# Open Task Manager (Ctrl+Shift+Esc)
# Check CPU and Memory usage
# Python.exe should use <200MB RAM normally
```

**Step 2: Database size**
```cmd
dir network_devices.db
# Should be <10MB for normal networks
# >100MB indicates cleanup needed
```

**Step 3: Network size**
Large networks (>100 devices) may scan slowly:
- Split into smaller subnets
- Use nmap for faster scanning
- Increase monitoring intervals

**Solutions:**

**Database cleanup:**
```cmd
venv\Scripts\activate.bat
python -c "from database import DatabaseManager; db = DatabaseManager(); db.cleanup_old_logs(7)"
```

**Browser optimization:**
- Close other tabs
- Disable browser extensions
- Clear browser cache
- Use Chrome for best performance

**Network optimization:**
- Scan smaller IP ranges
- Schedule scans for off-peak hours

### Issue 11: Dashboard accessible from other computers

**Security Concern:**
```
Other people can access my dashboard at:
http://my-computer-ip:5000
```

**This is actually a configuration issue, not normal behavior**

**Verification:**
```cmd
# Dashboard should only bind to localhost
# Check startup message for:
wsgi starting up on http://127.0.0.1:5000  ‚úÖ Good (localhost only)
wsgi starting up on http://0.0.0.0:5000    ‚ùå Bad (network accessible)
```

**Solution:**
Check app.py file contains:
```python
if __name__ == '__main__':
    socketio.run(app, host='127.0.0.1', port=5000)  # localhost only
    # NOT: socketio.run(app, host='0.0.0.0', port=5000)  # network accessible
```

# Port scanning instead of ping
```

**Step 3: Limited scanning**
- Focus on specific devices you manage
- Scan smaller IP ranges
- Use manual device addition instead of discovery

### Issue 13: VPN network issues

**Symptoms:**
- Different devices found when VPN connected
- Network range changes unexpectedly
- Cannot find local devices while on VPN

**VPN Behavior:**
- VPN assigns new IP address (e.g., 10.8.0.1)
- Local network may become inaccessible
- Split tunneling affects which devices are reachable

**Solutions:**

**Step 1: Understand VPN configuration**
```cmd
ipconfig /all

# Without VPN:
IPv4 Address: 192.168.1.100 (local network)

# With VPN:
IPv4 Address: 10.8.0.15 (VPN network)
IPv4 Address: 192.168.1.100 (local network, if split tunnel)
```

**Step 2: Choose scanning target**
- **Local network:** Disconnect VPN, scan 192.168.x.x
- **Remote network:** Stay on VPN, scan 10.x.x.x
- **Both networks:** Use split tunneling if available

**Step 3: VPN-specific configuration**
Some VPN clients allow:
- Local network access while connected
- Split tunneling configuration
- Route-specific settings
